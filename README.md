# Unexpected Behavior with Falsy Values in JavaScript Function

This repository demonstrates a common issue in JavaScript where a function designed to handle null values might not behave as expected when encountering other falsy values.  The initial code only explicitly checks for null values. This could lead to unintended results if the function is called with other values that evaluate to false, like 0, an empty string, or false itself. 

The solution demonstrates how to address this, considering various scenarios and implementing checks as needed.

## Bug Report

The `foo` function is intended to add two numbers.  However, it only explicitly handles null values. Other falsy values (0, "", false) are not addressed and might lead to unexpected behavior or errors in certain contexts.

## Solution

The solution provides an improved `foo` function which addresses other falsy values according to the desired behavior (e.g., treating them as 0, throwing an error, or using a default value).
